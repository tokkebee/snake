This is one of the first games I developed. It's a classic snake game where the player controls the snake and eats apples to grow. I developed while another person created the art assets.

You lose snake parts when you eat the poisoned apples (green) and gain when you eat the red ones.
Game is over when you bump into yourself or the walls, or lost all your body parts.
